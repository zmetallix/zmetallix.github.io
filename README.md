# Metallix (MTX) Official Website

This is the official website project for the Metallix (MTX) token, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

Metallix (MTX) is a Solana-based token offering holders a stake in the future outcomes of Wushuang Mining Company's exploration efforts. MTX token holders will be entitled to a share of the commercial transaction proceeds from Wushuang Mining Company's mining operations for the next three years, following the completion of the exploration report. Whether the mine is sold directly or commercially developed, the company will distribute 20% of the total revenue as dividends to token holders.
